Description of the app:
An app catered to less technically enthusiastic people that just want their computer to work and dont want to have to deal with temperature management.

Features:
When first run, the app automatically records the peak temperatures experienced by the computer within a load range. 
App runs in background recording the temperatures and load of the computer until it detects anomalies within the data. 
If the temperature and load doesnt match up with previously recorded data then an alert is given to the user that the computer is experiencing abnormal temperatures.

Any Other Information:
